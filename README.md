# chess
Building a chess engine from scratch. Not following any guides, just building it from intuition


## Things to implement
1. Representation (probably an array)
2. legal move calculator
3. piece class. subclasses for each piece
4. move evaluator
5. en passant, etc.

## Representation
Need a board class. Should have a piece_list variable.
